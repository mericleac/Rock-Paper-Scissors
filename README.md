# Rock-Paper-Scissors

A simple web page that allows the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors. 
The javascript function then uses math.random to choose a 'computer throw' and compares it against the player's throw.
Finally, javascript sends the result ('win', 'lose', or 'tie') to the HTML web page.
